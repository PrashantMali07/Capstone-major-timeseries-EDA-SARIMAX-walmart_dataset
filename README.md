# Capstone-major-timeseries-EDA-SARIMAX-walmart_dataset

In this project I have done the following tasks:
1. Have done a detailed EDA to obtain useful insights to help achieve more profit and maintain stocks accordingly.
2. Also, I have done data preprocessing where I have created time-based features to fitted the Multiple Regressor Models to check the overall performance of the model as per their RMSE, which performed more than enough, as it's a part of my experiment to achieve the goal.
3. At the end, I have done hypothesis testing, made the data stationary, and fitted a time series model, with ARIMA, SARIMA, and SARIMAX. In which, SARIMAX performed very well.

A retail store that has multiple outlets across the country are facing issues in managing the inventory - to match the demand with respect to supply. You are a data scientist, who has to come up with useful insights using the data and make prediction models to forecast the sales for X number of months/years.

## Dataset Information:
>> The walmart.csv contains 6435 rows and 8 columns.
Feature Name Description
* Store - Store number
* Date - Week of Sales
* Weekly_Sales - Sales for the given store in that week
* Holiday_Flag - If it is a holiday week
* Temperature - Temperature on the day of the sale
* Fuel_Price - Cost of the fuel in the region
* CPI - Consumer Price Index
* Unemployment - Unemployment Rate

## Tasks to be performed:
> 1. Using the dataset, come up with useful insights that can be used by each of the stores to improve in various areas.

> 2. Forecast the sales for each store for the next 12 weeks.
